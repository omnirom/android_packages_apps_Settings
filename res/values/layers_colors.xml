<!--
     This file contains "legacy" resource names from the Layers project,
     aka Layers 2.

     These names really shouldn't all be prefixed with exposed_*, as the
     justification for those names (making exposed values easy to identify)
     is achieved simply by sticking the colors in their own XML...

    <!-- This has no mapping in CM's commit...  What should map to it if anything?
         Most mappings to this in Layers are all of the changes to styles.xml which
         I'm still trying to understand as NONE of the ones referencing
         primary_text_light are in CM.  The only other reference to this is
         from battery_history_chart.xml which is WRONG - that's #ff000000
         and hence should be text_color_black (as it is in CM's commit...)
